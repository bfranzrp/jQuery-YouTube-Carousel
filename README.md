jQuery YouTube Carousel
Created by Michael Ouellette http://www.michaelouellette.com

Once you download the file add the contents to your site. Make sure you include 
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”path-to-css/youtubecarousel.css” type=”text/css”> to the 
head of the page and <script type=”text/javascript” src=”path-to-javascript/jquery.youtubecarousel.js”></script> 
to the footer of the page. You of course will need to include jQuery to the page in order for this to work. 
My suggestion is to grab the path file over at Google Libraries API and include that near the bottom of the 
page. Then all you have to do is place <div id=”yt_container”></div> somewhere in the body part of your 
document and everything should work for you.
